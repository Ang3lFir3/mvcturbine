MVC Turbine
===========

MVC Turbine is a plugin for ASP.NET MVC that has IoC baked in and auto-wires controllers, binders, view engines, http modules, etc. that reside within your application. Thus you worry more about what your application should do, rather than how it should do it.

Check out this [Channel9 video](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/jongalloway/Jon-Takes-Five-with-Javier-Lozano-on-MVC-Turbine) that explains a little bit about the project's purpose and features.

This source represents the v2.1 of MVC Turbine.  For getting the latest releases, go to [main portal site](http://turbineproject.com) or to start a conversation check out the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/mvcturbine).
